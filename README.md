- 👋 Hi, I’m @STiConneX
- 👀 I’m interested in topics such as IP,  IT, network, programming and computer science, big data processing with data analytics and modern skills management
- 🌱 I’m currently learning methods of data analytics, more details and some administrative things about softwarized, virtualized and distributed network technology and a growing number of different automation tasks by different divisions with unknown/unclassified risks for data integrity and as a result this could affect proper and save network operation
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... private network solutions for 5G campus networks (esp. 3.7-3.8 GHz usage in Germany) 
- 📫 How to reach me ... I will let you know if the time is right for us.
